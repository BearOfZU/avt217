	<h1>Cade Metz</h1>
	<p>I am a technology reporter for The New York Times, writing about artificial intelligence, driverless cars, robotics, <a href="../page3/index.html"> virtual reality </a> and other emerging areas.</p>
	<h3>What I Cover</h3>
	<p>I look for the technological advances that are poised to change society, for better or worse. The aim is to pinpoint these advances before most people are aware of them, but after it is clear that they will become a significant part of our everyday lives.
	</p>
	<h3>My Background</h3>
	<p>I have covered technology for 30 years at The Times, Wired Magazine and other publications. I majored in English literature in college and also studied math and computer science. My father was a computer programmer.

	I am the author of “Genius Makers: The Mavericks Who Brought A.I. to Google, Facebook, and The World,” the story of the people, ideas and companies behind the rapid rise of artificial intelligence.
	</p>
	<h3>Journalistic Ethics</h3>
	<p>As it says on my screen every time I open my laptop, my goal is to tell the truth and help people understand the world. That means ensuring not only that each sentence is true, but that each story gives the full picture of what is happening. As a Times journalist, I share the values and adhere to the standards of integrity outlined in The Times’s Ethical Journalism handbook.
